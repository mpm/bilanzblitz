This file just documents how this app was initially generated-

It should use vite_ruby and inertia_ruby, so it doesn't need the Rails JS stack so it was disabled:

rails new . --name=BilanzBlitz   --database=postgresql   --skip-hotwire   --skip-jbuilder   --skip-asset-pipeline   --devcontainer   --skip-javascript   --skip-bundle   --skip-test

then, run the devcontainer (when devcontainer CLI tools are installed on host machine):

`devcontainer up --workspace-folder .`

After the dev container setup is running, run commands with:

```
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . <command>
```

There is a shell alias `dcx` (dev container exec) that does this.


Then, I added inertia_rails and vite_rails to the Gemfile,
then I ran `bin/rails generate inertia:install` (which then installs vite ruby and asks for typescript etc.)

after this, the server is running under localhost:3100
